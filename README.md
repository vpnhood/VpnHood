### IPv6 Support
VpnHood supports IPv6, but in Windows, you need to be already on the IPv6 network, so all your network traffic will be tunneled through VpnHood.
In Windows, you will not have access to IPv6 sites if your network is not already configured to use IPv6.
In Android, however, you will get an Ipv6 address and access to all IPv6 sites regardless of your network configuration.
