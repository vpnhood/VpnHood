NOTE: This app REQUIRES A SERVER KEY.

VpnHood! CLIENT is a fast, secure, and reliable VPN solution powered by the ★★VpnHood! ENGINE★★, which is open-source and the first VPN developed fully with the .NET platform.

It is a client application that establishes encrypted, secure tunnels to a VPN server using the VpnHood protocol to VpnHood servers. The VpnHood protocol has no fingerprint and can not be detected by censorship filtering.


To use this app, a ServerKey is required. You can acquire one through the following methods: 

▶ Get server keys from friends or communities that distribute them.

▶ Purchase server keys for yourself or your friends through VpnHood! STORE or other sellers.

▶ Set up your own VpnHood server on a server hosting and create server keys yourself.


Key Features:

★ Free with No Ads: This is an open-source app that does not show Ads and is completely free.

★ Easy to Use: You can connect to our VPN with a simple click of the connect button.

★ Fast and Secure (The speed may be different for users according to the server providers and your Internet providers)

★ Open Source: Built on the open-source VpnHood engine (on GitHub), our app is transparent and trustworthy.

★ First VPN in .NET: We’re proud to be the first VPN app in the world to be developed with the .NET platform. This showcases our innovative approach and could attract tech-savvy users or those interested in unique tech solutions.

★ Broad Compatibility: Our app supports Android 6 and above, including Android TV and Windows

★ IPv4 & IPv6 Support: We support IPv4 and IPv6, ensuring maximum compatibility and performance.


Customizable Options:

✔ App Filtering: Choose which apps use the VPN with our filter options. You can exclude, include, or select all apps.

✔ Country Exclusion: This allows you to exclude your own country, ensuring that traffic to servers within your country does not pass through the VPN tunnel. This eliminates the necessity of disconnecting your VPN when accessing services in your country that do not accept connections from foreign IPs and increase your connections to servers in your country.

✔ Local Network Exclusion: Exclude your local network to maintain access to local resources while using the VPN.

✔ UDP / TCP Protocol: Choose whether to turn the UDP protocol on or off based on your needs.
