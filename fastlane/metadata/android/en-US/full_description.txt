NOTE: This app REQUIRES A SERVER KEY.

VpnHood! CLIENT is a fast, secure, and reliable VPN solution powered by the ★★VpnHood! ENGINE★★, which is open-source and the first VPN developed fully with the .NET platform.

It is a client application that establishes encrypted, secure tunnels to a VPN server using the VpnHood protocol to VpnHood servers. The VpnHood protocol has no fingerprint and cannot be detected by censorship filtering.

To use this app, a ServerKey is required. You can acquire one through the following methods:

▶ Get server keys from friends or communities that distribute them.

▶ Purchase server keys for yourself or your friends through the VpnHood! STORE or other sellers.

▶ Set up your own VpnHood server on a hosting service and create server keys yourself.

Customizable Options:

✔ Split Tunneling for App: Choose which apps use VpnHood! with flexible filter options. You can exclude, include, or select all apps.

✔ Split Tunneling for Country: This allows you to exclude your own country, ensuring that traffic to servers within your country does not pass through the VPN tunnel. This eliminates the need to disconnect VpnHood! when accessing services in your country that do not accept foreign IPs and improves connection speeds to local servers.
